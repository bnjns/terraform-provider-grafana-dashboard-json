# Data Source: grafana-dashboard-json_row

Rows are a way to group related panels. They do not actually contain the panels; instead any panels placed below the
row (but above the next row) are considered "within" the row.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "grafana-dashboard-json_row" "example" {
  title = "Example row"
  position = {
    top  = 0
    left = 0
  }
}

data "grafana-dashboard-json_row" "example2" {
  title    = "Example second row"
  position = data.grafana-dashboard-json_row.example.next_position.next_row
}

data "grafana-dashboard-json_dashboard" "example" {
  // other attributes

  panels = [
    data.grafana-dashboard-json_row.example.rendered_json,
    data.grafana-dashboard-json_row.example2.rendered_json,
  ]
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `title` (String) The text to display.

### Optional

- `position` (Attributes) The position of the top left corner of the panel. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--position))

### Read-Only

- `next_position` (Attributes) This allows you to easily align the "next panel" in the dashboard relative to this panel, without needing to know it's absolute position. The desired position can be passed directly to the next panel's `position` attribute. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--next_position))
- `rendered_json` (String) The JSON-encoded string of the row. This can be included in a dashboard by adding this to the `panels` attribute.

### Nested Schema for `position`

Required:

- `left` (Number) The offset from the left of the dashboard, as a column index. Must be between 0 and 23 (inclusive).

<a id="nestedatt--next_position"></a>
### Nested Schema for `next_position`

Read-Only:

- `below` (Attributes) The position directly below this panel (same offset from the left). (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--next_position--below))
- `next_row` (Attributes) The position at the start of the next row (below this panel, but at the left of the dashboard). (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--next_position--next_row))
- `right` (Attributes) The position directly to the right of this panel. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--next_position--right))

<a id="nestedatt--next_position--below"></a>
### Nested Schema for `next_position.below`

Read-Only:

- `left` (Number) The offset from the left of the dashboard, as a column index. Must be between 0 and 23 (inclusive).

### Nested Schema for `next_position.next_row`

Read-Only:
